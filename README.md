<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains a set of scripts that allow the automatic creation of different databases in cluster mode, namely from Redis, MongoDB, VoltDB, Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) and Presto. Alongside, there is a set of queries which allow a benchmark of the technologies to be performed. This benchmark is part of the SSB (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91563-0_28) and the basic principles of this Benchmark, extending these principles to highly complex Big Data contexts, particularly in the field of the human genome, in which the data, besides being vast and heterogeneous, have several relationships that need to be analysed.
